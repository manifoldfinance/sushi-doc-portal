# Miso

> Minimal Initial SushiSwap Offering

---

To enable new projects the best opportunity to launch cleanly onto the SushiSwap
exchange, the Ingredients listed above can be combined in various ways -
creating "Recipes". These recipes provide project teams the flexibility they
need to create the launch their token needs to succeed, without having to
needlessly dedicate their own researches to developing their own launch methods.
By making the MISO contracts open sourced, communities and investors can know
any launch they are participating in - no matter the "recipe" - comes with sound
and trusted mechanics. Recipes are combinations of smart contracts, bundled
together as users (project teams or founders) make selections from MISO's
offered options. Recipes may contain one or more options from each Ingredient
section, or in some cases may only require one or two ingredient choices - this
depends on the needs of the project and community. MISO ensures a strong
launchpad and successful migration event to the SushiSwap exchange, project
teams will only need to select their recipe and MISO starts cooking! With that,
we invite you into our kitchen and hope you enjoy the selection. Be sure to
offer any suggestions for new ingredients or share your own recipes to be added
to the official MISO menu!
