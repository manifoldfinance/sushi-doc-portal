#  Bentobox

## **What is BentoBox ?**

BentoBox (sometimes referred to as Bento) is a [smart contract](https://hackmd.io/@HHK-ETH/ry1Hi8I-Y) acting as the central vault for the entire Sushi ecosystem. Similar to how the banking system is the base-layer for financial operations in traditional finance, BentoBox is the base-layer for all future financial instruments Sushi intends to offer. In simple terms, BentoBox is like an Operating System powering your phone and Sushi products such as Trident, Limit Order, or Kashi are deemed as applications.

## **What are the benefits of BentoBox ?**

You may be wondering why we need BentoBox as the base layer for Sushi apps. Here is a list of the principal components and advantages that BentoBox offers when dApps are built on top of it:

For users:

- Funds in BentoBox can be used for flash loans to generate a small fee, thus generating extra yield for idle assets *([learn more about flash loans](https://hackmd.io/@HHK-ETH/what-is-a-flashloan))*.
- Idle funds in BentoBox can be deployed by the "Strategies" contracts. These contracts help to generate extra yield by sending the idle assets to low risk protocols like [Compound](https://compound.finance/) or the [SushiBar](https://hackmd.io/@HHK-ETH/ry1Hi8I-Y).
- Reduced gas fees when moving funds between Sushi apps: You can swap on Trident or lend on Kashi at a much cheaper gas fee than concurrent protocols.

For developers:

- Enable tracking of user’s deposits via artificial balance.
- Optimized deposit, withdrawal and skim functions that auto-convert ETH to wETH.
- Low gas (and fixed gas) transfers of tokens within the BentoBox.
- Simplified approval of tokens (no need to re-approve for each protocol).
- Minimal proxy contract factory built in. No need to roll out your own.
