## **Lending and borrowing in DeFi**

If you are new to DeFi,you may wonder how can people lend and ensure that they
will get their assets back?

Most lending protocols in DeFi use the same system: overcollateralized loans.

This means that borrowers need to lock a collateral in the system to be able to
borrow, this collateral needs to have a value superior than the loan.

For example, Alice can borrow 100$ of USDC if she locks 150$ of ETH in the
protocol. Then if the collateral value of Alice falls under the value of her
loan, her collateral will be sold against the asset she borrowed and the lender
will be repaid by the protocol. This is called liquidation.

So if we take our previous example: if ETH collateral value drops close to
100$, the protocol will sell it to repay the user that lent 100$ of USDC to
Alice.

Usually the liquidation happens way before the collateral value goes under the
loan value, usually 80% is the maximum, we call it LTV _(loan to value.)_ This
means that if the loan value if over 80% of the collateral value, collateral
will be liquidated.

This liquidations are called in by liquidation bots that monitor the protocol
earning a small fee when they do.

This systems allows anyone to borrow and lend from anywhere in the world,
without the need for third party (other than bots), everything working thanks to
smart contracts.

## **What is Kashi?**

Kashi is a lending and margin trading platform, built on
the¬†[BentoBox](https://www.notion.so/What-is-BentoBox-7e640bbaf82f44d0949fa7f0bc1beec7),
that allows for anyone to create customized and gas-efficient markets for
lending, borrowing, and collateralizing a variety of DeFi tokens, stable coins,
and synthetic assets. Kashi‚Äôs broad diversity of tokens is supported through the
use of a unique isolated market framework. Unlike traditional DeFi money markets
where high-risk assets can introduce risk to the entire protocol, in Kashi, each
market is entirely separate (similar to the Sushiswap DEX), meaning the risk of
assets within one lending market has no effect over the risk of another lending
market.

Traditional lending projects have permitted users to add liquidity into a
pool-based system. In these systems, if one of the assets were to drop in price
faster than liquidators could react, every user and every asset would be
negatively impacted. In this sense, the total risk of pool-based platforms
determined largely by the riskiest asset listed on the platform. This risk
increases with every extra asset that is added, leading to a very limited choice
in assets on most platforms. Kashi‚Äôs unique design enables a new kind of lending
and borrowing. The ability to isolate risks into individual lending markets
means that Kashi can permit users to add any token.

In addition, Kashi and SushiSwap together enables users to achieve leverage in
one click, without ever leaving the platform. Users can borrow an asset and swap
it instanlty against more collateral, thus leveraging a long on the collateral.

## **How is Kashi different from other lending platforms?**

The main difference is that Kashi uses lending markets, and isolated risk
markets, while other lending platforms both calculate risks globally, such that
the solvency of any token can affect the solvency of the whole platform. One
important consequence of using isolated risk markets is that Kashi is able to
allow any token to be listed. Another important consequence is that an elastic
interest rate is used to incentivize liquidity in a certain range. Yet another
consequence of lending pairs and isolated risk markets is that
Kashi‚Äôs¬†[oracles](https://www.notion.so/What-is-an-oracle-b94885ed0a9a4de88a2e7261190cf8a4)¬†need
to be customizable to provide price feeds for infinitely many tokens.

### **How to lend on Kashi**

_If you are new to Kashi, it is recommended to use a small amount and a cheap
chain so you can afford mistakes. In this article, we will use Kashi
on¬†[Polygon](http://polygon.technology)._

**Step 1:**¬†Go to¬†[https://app.sushi.com/lend](https://app.sushi.com/lend).

**Step 2:**¬†Select a pair with the asset you want to lend as well as a
collateral you trust.

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è The collateral selection is important, if you select a collateral that can drop in price really fast, liquidation bots may not have the time to liquidate borrowers before their collateral value is under their loan value resulting in a part of your funds being loss. 
So if you are new to DeFi, select a collateral with high market share (~top 50 marketcap).

</aside>

_In this example we will lend USDC on the WMATIC-USDC pair._

![https://i.imgur.com/na4axD1.png](https://i.imgur.com/na4axD1.png)

**Step 3:** \*\*Once you clicked on the pair, you‚Äôll be redirected to a new
interface, If its your first time using Kashi, you‚Äôll have
to¬†[approve](https://www.notion.so/What-is-a-token-approval-decfbde1fa3443e1a96218186f662219)¬†it.

Then select wallet or bentobox depending where your USDC comes from, enter an
amount and click on deposit.

**Good job ! Check your wallet
on¬†[etherscan](https://www.notion.so/Getting-started-with-Kashi-c4593b374d67474386ecec3d1073a48e),
you should have received KMP tokens, they reprensent your underlying liquidity
lent. You‚Äôll need them to get you liquidity back.** ‚úÖ

**Step 1:**¬†Go to¬†[https://app.sushi.com/borrow](https://app.sushi.com/borrow).

**Step 2:**¬†Select a pair with the collateral you have and the asset you want to
borrow.

_In this example we will use WMATIC as collateral and borrow USDC._

**Step 3:**¬†Once you clicked on the pair, you‚Äôll be redirected to a new

Then select wallet or Bentobox depending where your WMATIC comes from, enter an
amount to add as collateral and how much you want to borrow and select wallet or
Bentobox depending where the borrowed assets should be sent then click on
borrow.

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è *Do not click on the multipliers nor ‚ÄúSwap borrowed USDC for WMATIC collateral‚Äù, it will swap the borrowed assets against more collateral. This means going long/leverage your collateral, see more in the next part :¬†How to leverage with Kashi*

‚ö†Ô∏è Keep the percentage under ‚ÄúBorrowed‚Äù below 100% (75% of your collateral value) if you don‚Äôt want to be liquidated.

### **How to repay on Kashi**

**Step 1:**¬†Go to¬†[https://app.sushi.com/borrow](https://app.sushi.com/borrow).

**Step 2:**¬†Select the pair where your loan is and click on ‚ÄúRepay‚Äù.

_In this example its WMATIC as collateral and a USDC loan._

![https://i.imgur.com/mPwMIPn.png](https://i.imgur.com/mPwMIPn.png)

There is two way to repay your loan :

- Repay with the asset borrowed.
- Repay with collateral : this will sell a part of your collateral to payback
  the loan and will send the remaining collateral balance to BentoBox.

**Step 3.1:**¬†To repay with the borrowed asset, you‚Äôll need to have the asset in
your wallet or in BentoBox.

Enter the amount you want to repay and from where (BentoBox or wallet), enter
the amount of collateral you want to remove and to where (BentoBox or wallet)
then click on ‚Äúrepay and remove collateral‚Äù.

![https://i.imgur.com/b35pLl3.png](https://i.imgur.com/b35pLl3.png)

**Step 3.2:**¬†To repay with your collateral, simply check ‚ÄúSwap
collateral¬†`COLLATERAL NAME` (WMATIC in this case) for `ASSET NAME` (USDC in
this case) and repay" then click on ‚ÄúAutomatic repay‚Äù

**Good job ! Check your wallet or Bentobox depending where you sent the
collateral (BentoBox if used repay with collateral), tokens should appear
there.** ‚úÖ
