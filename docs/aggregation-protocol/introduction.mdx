# Bentobox

The BentoBox is a vault that holds tokens and generates yield from flash loans and strategies for any protocol built on top of it.

---

### Overview

Building any protocol on top of BentoBox provides these benefits:

- Extra yield from flash loans
- Extra yield from strategies
- Optimized deposit, withdraw and skim functions that auto-convert ETH to WETH
- Low gas (and fixed gas) transfers of tokens within the BentoBox
- Simplified approval of tokens (no need to reapprove for each protocol)
- Minimal proxy contract factory build in. No need to roll your own
