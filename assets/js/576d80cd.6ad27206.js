Reducing the cost of contract interactions is\nquite important because lower gas fees enable users to interact more often, and\nof course save money. Hence, in MasterChef V2, these units of storage have been\noptimized, and the total number of storage slots has been reduced from three to\none. Transactions on MasterChef V2 are much cheaper than in MasterChef V1,\nespecially when withdrawing and depositing SLP tokens."),(0,s.kt)("p",null,(0,s.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Double Rewards")," The second improvement of the MasterChef contract has to do\nwith allowing other projects to add incentives from their own treasuries on top\nof the $SUSHI rewards. In the original version of MasterChef, adding incentives\nfrom another project was technically difficult, and not necessarily intuitive\nfor other projects. In this sense, giving developers more tools to add their own\nrewards was clearly advantageous, as higher rewards promise increased liquidity,\nwhich would in turn lower slippage, and increase the overall profitability of\nthe network. Hence, in MasterChef V2, the rewards contract can be used to easily\nadd in rewards from other projects. These rewards can either be configured as a\nmultiple of the $SUSHI rewards, or they can be configured to another standard,\nlike block hash and block timestamp. Projects who would like to add their own\nincentives will need to be whitelisted to guarantee that our contracts are used\ncorrectly. We\u2019ll have more specific guidance on the application process very\nsoon, as well as a high-level overview to help developers implement double\nrewards."),(0,s.kt)("p",null,(0,s.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Claiming On-Demand")," The final major improvement has to do with the way users\nclaim rewards. In the first MasterChef contract, whenever you deposit a token\ninto MasterChef, the $SUSHI you accumulated beforehand were automatically sent\nout to you. Since ERC-20 transfers are expensive, this is not necessarily\nbehavior that the user wants, especially if the user is depositing LP tokens.\nHence, in MasterChef V2, the user can choose when and how to harvest their\nrewards. The contract does not automatically harvest their $SUSHI rewards when\nthe user deposits SLP tokens, and the user is able to harvest their rewards\nindependent of withdrawing. In combination with the improvement of gas\nefficiency, users may now choose to claim more often, and they can always do it\nwhen they choose."))}d.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
