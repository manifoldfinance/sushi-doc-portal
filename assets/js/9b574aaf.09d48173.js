The idea behind the independent rewarder contract is that it\nallows projects to distribute rewards at a rate that is determined by an\nindependent variable (time-based logic or block-based logic), and the number of\nSLP tokens the user has (17:42: Keno describes the types of logic available for\ncomplex rewarders). The developer can use any baseline to calculate the reward\nmultiplier independent of their $SUSHI allocation. Projects using the\nindependent rewarder can add rewards to a SushiSwap pool without having any\nallocation of $SUSHI at all. The following values are passed through the\nrewarder contract to determine the calculations for the user\u2019s rewards: the pool\nID, the user\u2019s address, the recipient\u2019s address, the pending $SUSHI amount, and\nthe new amount of LP tokens the user has after the event in question. In the\nexample complex rewarder given in the first paragraph, a hybrid model is used to\nkey into some of the storage advantages of MCV2, which allows for onSushiRewards\nto track any changes and harvest at the same time, which lowers the overhead\naccounting costs to a degree (18:36: Keno describes the hybrid model used)."),(0,a.kt)("h3",{id:"getting-your-contract-whitelisted"},"Getting Your Contract Whitelisted"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"After the status of the allocations for a project has been confirmed by the\nSushiSwap team, you can get started.
