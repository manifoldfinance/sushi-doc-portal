These recipes provide project teams the flexibility they\nneed to create the launch their token needs to succeed, without having to\nneedlessly dedicate their own researches to developing their own launch methods.\nBy making the MISO contracts open sourced, communities and investors can know\nany launch they are participating in - no matter the "recipe" - comes with sound\nand trusted mechanics. Recipes are combinations of smart contracts, bundled\ntogether as users (project teams or founders) make selections from MISO\'s\noffered options. Recipes may contain one or more options from each Ingredient\nsection, or in some cases may only require one or two ingredient choices - this\ndepends on the needs of the project and community. MISO ensures a strong\nlaunchpad and successful migration event to the SushiSwap exchange, project\nteams will only need to select their recipe and MISO starts cooking! With that,\nwe invite you into our kitchen and hope you enjoy the selection. Be sure to\noffer any suggestions for new ingredients or share your own recipes to be added\nto the official MISO menu!'))}u.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
